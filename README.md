Graylog plugin for Splunk
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graylog-labs/graylog-plugin-splunk.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/graylog-labs/graylog-plugin-splunk)

This plugin enables you to selectively forward log messages from Graylog, in real time to one or more Splunk deployments.

**Required Graylog version:** 2.0.0 and later

## Use cases

* Forward a subset of data for further analysis/correlation in Splunk to reduce Splunk license costs. 
  Example: All network firewall data is forwarded into Graylog for operations and initial security analysis. 
  A subset of the data such as failed login attempts or denied connections is then sent onto Splunk for further analysis/enrichment. 
  This can potentially reduce the amount of data indexed by Splunk, resulting in improved Splunk performace - less data to mine, better quality data to search on and reduced license cost.
  Retain all of your security logs in Graylog for compliance and archival requirements.  
* Use Graylog as a data router/noise filter. Forward 'actionable' data to Splunk, everything to a long-term archive (i.e. CSV output via the Graylog API) and anomalies/events to the primary monitoring system.

## Installation

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/graylog-labs/graylog-plugin-splunk/releases)
and place the `.jar` file in your Graylog plugin directory. The plugin directory
is the `plugins/` folder relative from your `graylog-server` directory by default
and can be configured in your `graylog.conf` file.

Restart `graylog-server` and you are done.

## Usage

### Configuring Splunk

In your Splunk web interface, go to *Settings -> Data Inputs* and add a new
TCP input. Use any port and leave both the *Source name override* and
*Only accept connection from* configuration options empty.

Click on *Next* to configure more details of the data input Graylog will send
data to.

Set the *Sourcetype* to *Miscellaneous -> generic_single_line* and leave the
other options as they are. If you know what you are doing you can of course
change any other settings as you wish.

Click on *Review* and then *Submit*. Remember the TCP port you configured
because you will have to configure Graylog to send data to it in the next step.

### Configuring Graylog

In Graylog, go to the outputs configuration of a stream and add a new "Splunk
output" like this:

All messages coming into that stream should now be forwarded to your Splunk setup
in realtime.

## Build

This project is using Maven and requires Java 7 or higher.

You can build a plugin (JAR) with `mvn package`.

DEB and RPM packages can be build with `mvn jdeb:jdeb` and `mvn rpm:rpm` respectively.

## Plugin Release

We are using the maven release plugin:

```
$ mvn release:prepare
[...]
$ mvn release:perform
```

This sets the version numbers, creates a tag and pushes to GitHub. TravisCI will build the release artifacts and upload to GitHub automatically.
